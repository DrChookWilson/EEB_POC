Moore, Tiara Nydia; Cuker, Benjamin Elias; 	Sedimentary Oxygen Demand and Orthophosphate Release: Sustaining Eutrophication in a Tributary of the Chesapeake Bay	Journal of Water Resources and Ocean Science	7	3	42	2020	Beginning in the mid 20th Century the Chesapeake Bay began to show the first signs of eutrophication, with seasonal depletion of free oxygen in bottom waters (hypoxia). Eutrophication is driven largely by external loading of phosphorus (P) and nitrogen (N). These nutrients maintain high levels of phytoplankton productivity and subsequent transfer of fixed carbon to the sediments. That carbon fuels heterotrophs that uptake free oxygen in the bottom waters at a faster rate than it can be replenished during seasonal stratification, resulting in periods of persistent hypoxia and anoxia. Aerobic and anaerobic decomposition of the settled plankton and detritus drives the release of remineralized nutrients such as orthophosphate (P). Episodic and seasonal mixing events transport the N and P to better illuminated surface waters where it supports blooms of phytoplankton, which will settle and continue the positive feedback loop of eutrophication. To better understand the role of sediments in the ongoing stress caused by eutrophication in the Chesapeake Bay we incubated sediment cores at temperatures to model an in situ seasonal cycle. We measured oxygen concentrations and P levels to estimate the release of orthophosphate to the overlying waters under various oxygen conditions. During oxic conditions the net flux of orthophosphate was from the water column into the sediments. Anoxia drove P flux from the sediments back to the water column. These results indicate internal P loading during periods of anoxia by the sediments to the water column may lead to continued eutrophication.		0000-0002-2422-6472	
Smith-Vidaurre, Grace; Araya-Salas, Marcelo; Wright, Timothy F; 	Individual signatures outweigh social group identity in contact calls of a communally nesting parrot	Behavioral Ecology	31	2	448-458	2020	Despite longstanding interest in the evolutionary origins and maintenance of vocal learning, we know relatively little about how social dynamics influence vocal learning processes in natural populations. The “signaling group membership” hypothesis proposes that socially learned calls evolved and are maintained as signals of group membership. However, in fission–fusion societies, individuals can interact in social groups across various social scales. For learned calls to signal group membership over multiple social scales, they must contain information about group membership over each of these scales, a concept termed “hierarchical mapping.” Monk parakeets (Myiopsitta monachus), small parrots native to South America, exhibit vocal mimicry in captivity and fission–fusion social dynamics in the wild. We examined patterns of contact call acoustic similarity in Uruguay to test the hierarchical mapping assumption of the signaling group membership hypothesis. We also asked whether geographic variation patterns matched regional dialects or geographic clines that have been documented in other vocal learning species. We used visual inspection, spectrographic cross-correlation and random forests, a machine learning approach, to evaluate contact call similarity. We compared acoustic similarity across social scales and geographic distance using Mantel tests and spatial autocorrelation. We found high similarity within individuals, and low, albeit significant, similarity within groups at the pair, flock and site social scales. Patterns of acoustic similarity over geographic distance did not match mosaic or graded patterns expected in dialectal or clinal variation. Our findings suggest that monk parakeet social interactions rely more heavily upon individual recognition than group membership at higher social scales.  		0000-0002-0155-8159	
Leasi, Francesca; Gaynus, Camille; Mahardini, Angka; Moore, Tiara N; Norenburg, Jon L; Barber, Paul H; 	Spatial and ecologic distribution of neglected microinvertebrate communities across endangered ecosystems: meiofauna in Bali (Indonesia)	Marine ecology	37	5	970-987	2016	Biodiversity estimations, particularly in vulnerable tropical regions, are essential to understanding ecosystem structure, function and conservation. While threats to marine and terrestrial ecosystems have fueled increased interest in biodiversity research, information on meiofauna, a key trophic and ecologic community of microscopic organisms that lives within sediments, is still lacking. Here we report the results of a faunistic investigation conducted in Bali, Indonesia. The results reveal that the biodiversity of marine meiofauna in Bali is very high. Meiofauna from coral reefs, sand flats and seagrass beds differed significantly in abundance and diversity. Nonetheless, overall community compositions show that meiofauna communities are affected by environmental variables. The high meiofaunal diversity observed in Bali, a low diversity region of the Coral Triangle, indicates the importance of further meiofaunal research		0000-0001-6995-0934
